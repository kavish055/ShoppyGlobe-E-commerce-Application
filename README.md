ShoppyGlobe - React E-commerce Application
ShoppyGlobe is a basic yet feature-rich e-commerce web application built with React using Vite as the project setup tool. It demonstrates the complete flow of an online store with product listing, detailed views, cart management, checkout, and routing, all implemented with modern React best practices.

Key Features
Component-Based Architecture: Modular and reusable components including Header, ProductList, ProductItem, ProductDetail, Cart, CartItem, and NotFound.

Data Fetching: Fetches product data from a remote API with a custom hook using useEffect. Includes error handling for failed requests.

State Management: Uses Redux for robust state handling of cart items and product search filtering.

Event Handling: Add/remove items in the cart, and adjust quantities with constraints.

React Router: Dynamic routing with createBrowserRouter for Home, Product Detail, Cart, and Checkout pages.

Performance Optimization: Implements code splitting and lazy loading for components and images using React.lazy and Suspense.

Responsive Styling: Responsive and user-friendly UI with custom CSS.

Form and Checkout: Dummy checkout form with order placement and cart reset functionality.

Robust Development Practices: Over 25 meaningful commits to demonstrate progressive development, well-commented code, and clean project structure without node_modules.

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of building a production-level React application following best practices and modern tooling.
